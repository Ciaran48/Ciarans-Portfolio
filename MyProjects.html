      <p class="text"> Machine Learning will be discussed from economics, Warfare, Medicine and even Governments to
        grasp a better understanding of how powerful machine learning. Two Models will be used to compete against one
        another helping grasp which Model is more effective The Models are the support vector machine (SVM) and Linear
        Regression Model (LRM).

      <p class="text">The aim of this study is to determine if machine learning can be effective at predicting
        pandemics,
        in this instance the prediction will be the deaths, cases and recoveries of the current Covid-19 Pandemic. This
        will be created by a single developer and no funding with a limited dataset that does not include factors which
        may contribute to the real world outcome</p>
